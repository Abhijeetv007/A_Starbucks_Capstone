Problem Statement / Dimensions

The problems I choose to solve are:

- If there is someone who will respond to offers.

-what will be the best offer type.

-Average income of owners.

-Discount and increase BOGO apparel buyer rating.

I will create and train models that will determine if the person will respond to the proposal. If yes, then the model chooses the best offer type (discount or bogo). I also compare the completeness of the KNeighbourClassifier and SVC models.
